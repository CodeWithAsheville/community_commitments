# We are Code with Asheville
(Formerly Code for Asheville)

We are people who care about our community and want to help make it better.
We use technology to address social issues that impact our community.

- We build apps, websites and dashboards.
- We connect communities with essential technologies.
- We help grass-roots activists use data to inform their policy advocacy.

And weâ€™re not just coders.
Code with Asheville members range from hard-core programmers and data geeks to neighborhood organizers and social activists working with local governments to find creative solutions to our common challenges.

## What we do
**Civic Technology**
Projects that create new capabilities in our community, like Sunshine Request, the Reentry Hub, or the Beloved Computer Lab.

**Data for Policy Advocacy**
Projects that help the community use data to more effectively advocate for positive change, such as the work on racial disparities in traffic stops or homeless interactions with law enforcement.

**Bringing People Together**
Events and activities that forge new connections within our communities, such as ReRoute AVL, Open Data Day and our collaboration with UniteWNC.
