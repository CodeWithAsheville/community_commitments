# We are Code with Asheville
(Formerly Code for Asheville)

We are people who care about our community and want to help make it better.
We use technology to address social issues that impact our community.

- We build apps, websites and dashboards.
- We connect communities with essential technologies.
- We help grass-roots activists use data to inform their policy advocacy.

And weâ€™re not just coders.
Code with Asheville members range from hard-core programmers and data geeks to neighborhood organizers and social activists working with local governments to find creative solutions to our common challenges.
